      <h2>Why is this necessary?</h2>
      <p>When a survivor of domestic violence is able to successfully obtain an emergency order of protection against his or her abuser, that emergency order only lasts for at most three weeks. In order to get a long term order of protection, a summons must be physically handed to the abuser. If that hasn't happened--and in the current system it frequently does not--courts will wait three weeks again. And again. And again.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-4">
      <h2>The Current Process</h2>
      <p>Currently, the way that orders of protection are served is through either the sheriff’s department, which is free, or through a certified process server or private detective agency, which are cost prohibitive for low-income survivors. The sheriff’s department only makes one attempt to serve the order, and if the person to be served isn’t at the one address provided, then either the order expires and is effectively rendered useless or the survivor must appear in court again.</p>

      <h2>Crowdsourcing Process Serving</h2>
      <p>DV Serve targets a small, quantifiable problem and fixes it with a simple, practical solution. It leverages crowdsourcing and the ready availability of information on the web to lift one of the barriers that stops domestic violence victims from moving forward in their lives.</p>
