      <h2>Why is this necessary?</h2>
      <p>When a survivor of domestic violence is able to successfully obtain an order of protection against his or her abuser, that order is typically only valid for a period of three weeks. For the order of protection to take effect, the order must be physically served to the abuser within those three weeks.</p>
      <p>Currently, the way that orders of protection are served is through either the sheriff’s department, which is free, or through a certified process server or private detective agency, which are cost prohibitive for low-income survivors. The sheriff’s department only makes one attempt to serve the order, and if the abuser isn’t at the one address provided, then either the order expires and is effectively rendered useless or the survivor must appear in court again (and the day(s) off of work and child-care that requires).</p>
